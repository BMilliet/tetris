# tetris

This tetris app is written in Swift using UIKit only.
No need to install anything other than regular Xcode IDE.

The main goal of this project for me was study 2D arrays. To make it a little bit more fun i dicided to make a tetris game.

## WIP [TODOS]

- store best scored.
- down arrow actually move shape all the way down.
- move floating pieaces down.
- make arrows using regular UIView instead of icons so i can remove iOS 13 requirement.
